    <h2>
        the all-in-one <br>wonder
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Engineering_OP-1" target="_blank" title="OP-1 specification">OP-1</a></strong> is the all-in-one portable synthesizer, sampler and controller. with additional features like a built-in FM radio and an assignable <strong><u>G-force</u> sensor</strong> for motion controlled effects, there is nothing quite like it.
    </p>
    <p>
        its modular architecture enables endless sound possibilities without making the workflow complicated or distracting.
    </p>
    <p>
        the compact design and real physical interface makes it inspiring to create music, no matter who you are or how experienced you are.
    </p>
    <h2>
        신디사이저 <br>and 컨트롤러
    </h2>
    <p>
        with thirteen synthesizer engines, seven high quality effects and multiple routable LFO’s, you'll never hit the wall when it comes to creativity or finding the right sound for the job. add the unique built-in sequencers on top of that and you'll understand why so many highly regarded producers and artists hold this little machine so dear.
    </p>
    <p>
        in controller mode, <strong>OP-1</strong> turns in to a full blown MIDI controller, with access to transport (play/stop, rec, rewind and forward), a two octave keyboard with four endless encoders as well as a sound module that can be controlled from virtually any external software.
    </p>
    <h2>
        4-track <br>tape 특징
    </h2>
    <p>
        record anything you create with the <strong><u>4-track</u> tape</strong> feature. match the tape speed to the sequencer tempo for some really nice overdubbing. change tapespeed while recording, or record backwards in realtime. switch to the 4 channel mixer and add some punch with the built in EQ and compressor.
    </p>
    <p>
        finally, create a live mix in album mode on a virtual vinyl.
    </p>
